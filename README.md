I work as a programmer. I spend most of my time developing web applications.
I am familiar with the creation and support of projects on MERN and Go Bin. 
In addition, there is little experience in creating C# - based applications .Net Core. 
I will be glad to help!

ðŸŒ± I am currently trying to delve deeper into the work of full-stack developer on node js
